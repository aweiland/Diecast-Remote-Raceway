# Diecast-Remote-Raceway
The Diecast Remote Raceway (DRR) allows participants to race 1:64 scale die-cast cars (such as the popular Hot WheelsÂ® cars from Mattel), head-to-head, from remote locations.  A DRR consists of an automated Starting Gate, an electronic Finish Line, and a web service that coordinates races between multiple raceways via the internet.
